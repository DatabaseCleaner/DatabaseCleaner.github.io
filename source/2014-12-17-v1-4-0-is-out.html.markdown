# Database Cleaner v1.4.0 is out!

The latest version contains a couple of new features, some performance upgrades and, of course, bug fixes. More specifically:

## New features

* Support for Neo4j. (by @dpisarewski)
* Support for multiple connections on Mongoid. (by @nyarly)

## Better performance

* Using the deletion strategy with Mysql now only deletes those tables which have had records added to them. (by @MadRabbit)
* Add support for `pre_count` on Sequel with Mysql. (by @vrinek)
* Cache collection names in mongo's truncation strategy. (by @nyarly)

## Bug fixes

* Fix `undefined method error` with DataMapper SQLite adaptor. (by @lanej)
* Fully define Mysql2 adaptor constant. (by @jgonera)
* Don't truncate schema tables in Postgres. (by @billywatson)
* Fix issue where Moped cleaner was missing collections with 'system' in their name. (by @MartinNowak)

## Roadmap to v2.0

Apart from v1.4.0 there has been some discussion about v2.0 and the possibility of splitting the gem into a core with sub-gems for the various ORMs (more [here](https://github.com/DatabaseCleaner/database_cleaner/issues/307)).
